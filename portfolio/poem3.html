            <h1>Unravelling</h1>
            <p>
                <!--Used <br> here without a closing /br as per my mistake on HTML Lab 01-->
                Whenever I stop and begin to idle
                <br>
                I begin to look back on my days
                <br>
                I wish I could stop it all
                <br>
                There were so many ways
                <br>
                <br>
                And yet I failed in all of them
                <br>
                And as I succumb
                <br>
                I am wrapped within the diadem
                <br>
                That of which is mayhem
            </p>
